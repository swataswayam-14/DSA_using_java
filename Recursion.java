//Recursion
/*Prerequisites
 * iteration
 * functions
 * Use of recursion:-
 * Trees
 * Graphs
 * Dynamic Programming
 */
//everything that can be solved using iteration can be solved using recursion
//depending on the problem we can choose which one to use

/*
 * Recursion is a method of solving a computational
 problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller
 instances of the same problem
 */
// summarising recursion is three steps:-
/*
 * Base Case
 * Work
 * inner function call
